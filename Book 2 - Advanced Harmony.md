## Part I: Extended Chords (Color)

If triads are primary colors, **Extensions** are the shading and texture. We stack more 3rds on top of the 7th to reach the 9th, 11th, and 13th.

### 1.1 Major 7th Chords
**Formula: 1 - 3 - 5 - 7**
Imagine a Major triad, but you add a note that is just one half-step below the octave. This adds a soft, fuzzy layer of nostalgia. It is the core sound of Lo-Fi Hip Hop and Jazz Ballads.

### 1.2 Dominant 7th Chords
**Formula: 1 - 3 - 5 - b7**
Take a Major triad, but add a *flatted* 7th. This creates a "Tritone" interval inside the chord (between the 3rd and the b7). This internal friction makes the chord sound bluesy and edgy. It is the driving force of almost all chord progressions—it wants desperately to push you home to the Tonic.

### 1.3 Minor 7th Chords
**Formula: 1 - b3 - 5 - b7**
A Minor triad with a flat 7. This takes the "sadness" of a minor chord and makes it sound "mellow" or "sophisticated" instead. It is the main chord used in Deep House and Neo-Soul.

### 1.6 Extensions: The 9th
Adding the 9th creates a rich, sophisticated sound. Dom9 chords are the staple of James Brown Funk. Maj9 chords are the staple of Neo-Soul.

## Part II: Functional Harmony

### 2.4 Secondary Dominants
Once you understand that V7 pulls to I, you can "hack" the system. You can treat *any* chord in your progression as a temporary "I" chord, and precede it with its own "V7".

For example, in C Major, the ii chord is Dm. If you want to emphasize Dm, you can play the V7 of Dm (which is A7) right before it. This is called a Secondary Dominant.

> **Listen For:** The bridge of "Yesterday" by The Beatles. The chord progression goes Em -> A7 -> Dm. The A7 is the Secondary Dominant pointing to Dm.

### 2.5 Tritone Substitution
This is the "Secret Handshake" of Jazz musicians. It allows you to replace a Dominant 7th chord with another Dominant 7th chord exactly a **Tritone (6 semitones) away**.

Why does it work? Because they share the same Tritone! In G7, the tritone is B & F. In Db7, the tritone is F & Cb (B). Since the "active ingredients" are the same, they perform the same function, but the Db7 allows for a cool chromatic bass line (D -> Db -> C).

## Part III: The Modes (Flavors)

Modes are simply the Major Scale starting from a different note. If you play the C Major scale but start and end on D, you are playing **D Dorian**. The notes are the same, but the "center of gravity" shifts, creating a totally different mood.

### 3.2 Dorian (The Jazz Minor)
Built on the 2nd degree. It has a natural 6th, making it brighter than standard minor. It is the sound of "So What" by Miles Davis and "Oye Como Va".

### 3.3 Phrygian (The Exotic Minor)
Built on the 3rd degree. It features a b2. It sounds Spanish, heavy, or metal.

### 3.4 Lydian (The Dream Mode)
Built on the 4th degree. It features a #4. It sounds floaty, magical, and Sci-Fi. It is the sound of *The Simpsons* theme and many John Williams scores (E.T.).

### 3.5 Mixolydian (The Rock Major)
Built on the 5th degree. It features a b7. It sounds like a Major scale with a bluesy edge. Used by The Beatles ("Norwegian Wood") and AC/DC.

## Part IV: Modern & Jazz Concepts

### 4.1 Shell Voicings
Amateurs stack chords 1-3-5-7. Pros use **Voicings**. A Shell Voicing strips the chord down to its absolute skeleton. You play only the **Root, 3rd, and 7th**. This frees up your other fingers to play extensions or melody. Often, the Root is even dropped (Rootless Voicings) because the bass player is already playing it.

### 4.3 Quartal Harmony (So What)
Instead of stacking notes in 3rds (Tertain harmony), we stack them in **4ths**. This creates a very modern, ambiguous sound. It was popularized by McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans.

### 4.5 Altered Dominants
To create maximum tension, we alter the extensions. The most famous example is the **Sharp 9 (#9)**. It clashes against the major 3rd, creating a bluesy "growl" famously used by Jimi Hendrix (the "Hendrix Chord").

### 4.8 Bebop Enclosures
In Bebop, you rarely play a target note directly. You "encircle" it first. You might play the note *above* it, then the note *below* it, and *then* the target note. This creates a sense of momentum and "landing."
