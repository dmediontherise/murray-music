## Preface: The Language of Sound

Imagine trying to write a novel without knowing the alphabet. You might be able to tell a story out loud, but you couldn't write it down or share it effectively. Music is exactly the same.

Music Theory is not a set of rigid rules designed to stifle your creativity. It is simply the labeled map of the territory. It allows you to say "I want a sad sound" and know exactly which keys to press to get it, rather than hunting and pecking until you stumble upon it.

This book works in tandem with the **Murray's Theory Web App**. When you see a symbol like `[Interactive Drill]`, open the app to play and hear the concept.

## Part I: The Atoms (Intervals)

If chords are words and scales are sentences, then **Intervals** are the individual letters. An interval is simply the measurement of distance between two notes. The "mood" of a song usually comes down to which intervals are emphasized.

### 1.1 The Semitone (Tension)
The **Semitone** (or Minor 2nd) is the smallest distance you can move on a piano. It is the very next key, whether that key is black or white. Because the notes are so close together, the sound waves clash, creating a "rubbing" or "buzzing" dissonance.

> **Visual:** Two adjacent keys (e.g., C and C#).
> **Listen For:** The *Jaws* theme. That menacing "duh-dun... duh-dun" is simply a semitone moving back and forth. It creates instant tension.

### 1.2 The Whole Tone (Movement)
A **Whole Tone** (Major 2nd) is exactly what it sounds like: two semitones. If you play C, skip C#, and play D, you have moved a whole step. This interval sounds much smoother. It feels like "walking" forward.

> **Visual:** White key to White key (skipping a black key), or Black to Black (skipping white).
> **Listen For:** The first two notes of "Happy Birthday" (Hap-py) are a whole step apart.

### 1.4 The Minor 3rd (Sadness)
This is the single most important interval for emotional context. A **Minor 3rd** is 3 semitones. It creates the sound of sadness, seriousness, or melancholy. It is the defining distance between the Root and the 3rd of a Minor Chord.

> **Listen For:** The opening of "Greensleeves" or a lullaby.

### 1.5 The Major 3rd (Happiness)
The counterpart to the Minor 3rd. A **Major 3rd** is 4 semitones. It sounds bright, happy, and stable. When you hear a generic "happy" song on the radio, it is built on Major 3rds.

### 1.7 The Tritone (The Devil in Music)
Between the Perfect 4th and Perfect 5th lies the **Tritone** (6 semitones). Historically known as *Diabolus in Musica* ("The Devil in Music"), it is the most unstable interval in Western music. It sounds like a siren or a warning. It creates a desperate need to resolve to a safer note.

> **Listen For:** The very first interval in *The Simpsons* theme song ("The Simp-").

### 1.8 The Perfect 5th (Power)
If you count up 7 semitones from your root note, you land on the **Perfect 5th**. This is the "anchor" of music. It sounds hollow, strong, and incredibly stable. Rock guitarists call this a "Power Chord" because it adds weight without adding "emotional flavor" (like sadness or happiness).

> **Listen For:** The opening horn blast of the *Star Wars* main theme.

## Part II: The Palette (Scales)

Imagine you are a painter. You have millions of colors available, but if you mix them all together, you get brown sludge. To paint a beautiful picture, you select a specific **Palette** of colors that work well together.

A **Scale** is exactly that: a limited palette of notes chosen from the 12 available tones. Most Western music uses a palette of just 7 notes.

### 2.1 The Chromatic Scale
What if you *don't* skip any notes? If you play every single key in order, you are playing the **Chromatic Scale**. Because it lacks a "center" or "home," it sounds disorienting, like a swarm of bees or a falling cartoon character.

### 2.2 The Major Scale (Ionian)
The Major scale is the sound of "Home." It sounds happy, bright, and heroic. It is built using a very specific formula of Whole (W) and Half (H) steps:

**W - W - H - W - W - W - H**

If you start on C and follow this formula, you hit every white key and miss every black key. This is why C Major is the first scale everyone learns.

### 2.3 The Natural Minor Scale (Aeolian)
If Major is "Day," then Minor is "Night." Minor scales evoke sadness, seriousness, introspection, or anger. We make a scale "Sad" by **lowering the 3rd note**.

### 2.4 The Harmonic Minor Scale
Sometimes, the Natural Minor sounds a bit *too* "polite." Composers wanted a stronger pull back to the root note, so they raised the 7th note by a half step. This creates a large gap (an Augmented 2nd) between the 6th and 7th notes, giving the scale an exotic, "snake charmer" or Middle Eastern quality.

## Part III: Building Blocks (Triads)

A single note is a dot. Two notes are a line (Interval). But **three notes** create a shape. A "Triad" is the most basic form of a chord. It consists of three notes stacked in 3rds: A Root, a 3rd, and a 5th.

### 3.1 Major Triads
**Formula: 1 - 3 - 5**
This chord sounds stable, resolved, and happy. It is the musical equivalent of a smile.

### 3.2 Minor Triads
**Formula: 1 - b3 - 5**
We take the Major triad and lower the middle note (the 3rd) by one half step. Suddenly, the smile turns into a frown. The chord becomes sad or serious.

### 3.3 Diminished Triads
**Formula: 1 - b3 - b5**
Here, we lower the 3rd AND the 5th. This squeezes the chord into a tight, tense shape. It sounds anxious, like someone looking over their shoulder. It is usually found as a passing chord, quickly resolving to something more stable.

### 3.4 Augmented Triads
**Formula: 1 - 3 - #5**
Here, we raise the 5th. This expands the chord, making it feel "stretched." It sounds dreamy, floating, or confused. It feels like you are underwater or in a dream sequence.

## Part IV: Basic Harmony

How do chords move? Why does one chord lead to another?

### 4.1 The I-IV-V Progression
This is the bedrock of Rock, Blues, and Country. In the key of C:
*   **I (One):** C Major (Home)
*   **IV (Four):** F Major (Away)
*   **V (Five):** G Major (Tension)

The V chord always wants to resolve back to the I chord. This cycle creates the feeling of a journey and return.

### 4.2 The ii-V-I Progression
This is the bedrock of Jazz. Instead of using the IV chord (Major), we use the ii chord (Minor). In C, this is **D Minor**.
*   **ii:** D Minor
*   **V:** G Major
*   **I:** C Major

This creates a smoother, more sophisticated movement toward home.

### 4.3 Inversions
Beginners often play chords by jumping their whole hand up and down the keyboard. Professionals do not do this. They use **Inversions**. An inversion is simply rearranging the furniture. It's the same notes, just in a different order. This allows you to move from C Major to F Major without barely moving your hand.
